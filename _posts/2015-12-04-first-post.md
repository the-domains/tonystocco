# Testing the grid.

With just five weeks of football left on the NFL calendar, most players have already made their mark in terms of how observers will look back at their 2015 campaigns. It'll go down as a great year for DeAndre Hopkins and a terrible one for Ryan Tannehill. At the extremes, it's going to be exceedingly difficult for players to re-write their 2015 story.
There are a fair number of players and coaches around the league, though, who could have their short- and long-term professional futures defined by what happens to them over the remainder of the regular season (and, if applicable, the playoffs to come). 

What they do between now and February might very well mean more than what has happened over the first three months of the season. They're the Must-December Team.
You can probably figure out which sorts of personnel will be appearing here. The most obvious subset would include players who are about to hit unrestricted free agency -- think about the likes of Byron Maxwell and Paul Kruger when it comes to recent players who have cashed in on short stretches of above-average play.
